					<i>Kishkindha Kand</i> primarily focuses on the story of <i>vanara King <font color="red">Vali</font></i>(also known as <font color="red">Bali</font>). 
					It is based in the ape citadel, <i><font color="red">Kishkindha</font></i>. Rama and Lakshmana meet <font color="red">Hanuman</font>, the greatest devotee to Lord Rama. In Kishkindha 
					Kanda, Rama helps <font color="red">Sugriva</font> by defeating his elder brother Vali, due to which Sugriva regains the hold of his kingdom of 
					Kishkindha. Rama helps Sugriva so that he in return helps him to find Sita.
					</p>
					<p>
					However soon Sugriva forgets his promises to Rama. The wife of former king Vali, <font color="red">Tara</font> very cleverly reminds Sugriva of 
					them and convinces him to help Rama. She also stops enraged Rama from destroying the citadel. Finally, Sugriva sends search armies of vanars to all 
					the corners of the Earth. The armies from north, west and east return with no answer. The southern army, under the exquisite leadership of 
					<font color="red">Angad</font> and Lord Hanuman discover from a vulture named <font color="red">Sampati</font> that Sita is taken to <font color="red">Lanka</font>.
