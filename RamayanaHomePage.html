		<font color= "Orange">The Ramayana (Sanskrit: रामायण )</font> belongs to the broad classification of Sanskrit Literature known as <font color="orange">kavya 
		(poetry)</font>. However, Ramayana is not only a kavya, it’s also considered to be a <font color="orange">mahakavya (ancient heroic epic poem)</font>. It 
		is ascribed to the Hindu sage <font color="orange">Valmiki</font> and forms an important part of the Hindu canon. The Ramayana is one of the two great epics 
		of India, the other being the <font color="orange">Mahabharata</font>. It depicts the duties of relationships, portraying ideal characters like the ideal 
		servant, the ideal brother, the ideal wife and the ideal king.
		<br><br>
		The name <i>Ramayana is a tatpurusha compound of <font color="orange">Rama and Ayana ("going, advancing")</font></i>, translating to <font color="orange">"Rama's 
		Journey"</font>. The Ramayana consists of 24,000 verses in seven books (<i>kandas</i>) and 500 cantos (<i>sargas</i>),and tells the story of Rama (an incarnation 
		of the Hindu preserver-God <font color="orange">Vishnu</font>), whose wife <font color="orange">Sita</font> is abducted	by <i>the demon king of Lanka, 
		<font color="orange">Ravana</font></i>. Thematically, the epic explores the tenets of human existence and the concept of <font color="orange">dharma</font>.
		<br><br>
		Verses in the Ramayana are written in a 32-syllable meter called <i>Anustubh</i>. The epic was an important influence on later Sanskrit poetry and Indian life and 
		culture, particularly through its establishment of the shloka meter. Like its epic cousin the Mahabharata, the Ramayana is not just an ordinary story, it 
		contains the teachings of ancient Hindu sages and presents them in narrative allegory with philosophical and the devotional elements interspersed. The 
		characters <font color="orange">Rama</font>, <font color="orange">Sita</font>, <font color="orange">Lakshmana</font>, <font color="orange">Bharata</font>, 
		<font color="orange">Hanuman</font> and <font color="orange">Ravana</font> are all fundamental to the cultural consciousness of India.
		<br><br>
		According to Hindu tradition, the Ramayana takes place during a period of time known as <font color="orange">Treta Yuga</font>. In its extant form, Valmiki’s 
		Ramayana is an epic poem of some 50,000 lines. The text survives in several thousand partial and complete manuscripts; the oldest of which appears to date from 
		the 11th century A.D. The text has several regional renderings, recensions and subrecensions.
		<br><br>
		The Great Epic Ramayana is traditionally divided into seven Kandas (books), which are the following:
		<ul>
			<li>Bala Kanda</li>
			<li>Ayodhya Kanda</li>
			<li>Aranya Kanda</li>
			<li>Kishkindha Kanda</li>
			<li>Sundara Kanda</li>
			<li>Yuddha Kanda</li>
			<li>Uttara Kanda</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		Each Kanda deals with a particular period of Rama’s life in chronological order.
