					The <i>Yuddha Kanda</i> is the greatest of the <i><font color="black">Kandas</font></i>, as it contains the accounts of the Great Ramayana War 
					between Rama’s and Ravana’s army. This Kanda also has the description of the story as to how the great Rama <i>Setu bridge</i> was built across 
					the sea, using stones that floated on water as they had Rama’s name engraved on them. It was through this bridge that Rama and his great army 
					crossed over to <i>Lanka</i>. Rama was even joined by Ravana’s renegade brother, <font color="black">Vibhishana</font>.
					</p>
					<p>
					This Kanda also has the great Hindu Epic story of <font color="black">Hanuman</font> carrying an entire <i><font color="black">Mount Sumeru</font></i> 
					to Lanka, as he could not identify which herb would cure Lakshmana, who was seriously injured with a powerful weapon hurled at him by 
					<font color="black">Indrajit</font>, Ravana’s son. Eventually the war ends when Rama kills Ravana, and he crowns <font color="black">Vibhishana</font> 
					on the throne of Lanka.
					</p>
					<p>
					The great <i>Agni Pareeksha</i>, the test performed by Sita to prove her purity, is accounted in this book. Sita plunges into the sacrificial 
					fire, on Rama’s orders. The lord of fire, <font color="black">Agni</font> raised and returns Sita unharmed, thus proving the integrity of her 
					soul and body. At the end of the Yuddha Kanda, Rama’s exile tenure is also complete and he returns to <i>Ayodhya</i> welcomed with lights and 
					celebrations.
